# Files
[Raw_read_QC_trim.sh](https://github.com/natforsdick/Himantopus/blob/master/Raw_read_QC_trim.sh) is a script for performing quality control for short-read whole genome sequencing data. It uses FastQC to assess raw read quality, Trimmomatic for adapter removal, and ConDeTri for quality trimming and read deduplication.

[Streamlined_GBS_pipeline.md](https://github.com/natforsdick/Himantopus/blob/master/Streamlined_GBS_pipeline.md) describes a straightforward analysis pipeline for GBS data including demultiplexing, mapping, variant discovery and filtering, and additional pre-processing prior to analysis with ADMIXTURE and/or adegenet.

[admixture_array_nesi.sh](https://github.com/natforsdick/Himantopus/blob/master/admixture_array_nesi.sh) is a SLURM array script to run ADMIXTURE, with ten iterations for each value of K from 1 - 10. 

[pophelper-analysis.Rmd](https://github.com/natforsdick/Himantopus/blob/master/pophelper-analysis.Rmd) is an Rmarkdown script to merge and visualise the results of multiple iterations of ADMIXTURE analysis. 

[Forsdick-et-al_Stilts_SNPRelate.Rmd](https://github.com/natforsdick/Himantopus/blob/master/Forsdick-et-al_Stilts_SNPRelate.Rmd) includes the methods used to perform population clustering, and estimation of relatedness and Fst using the R package SNPRelate. The results of this analysis are appended as Supplementary File 1 in [Forsdick et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gecco.2021.e01681).
